# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

- Analyze data set of Fundraisers in the United States in the Theatre category/Play subcategory based on two measurements, outcome by launch date and outcome by fundraising goal.

### Purpose

- Compare the client’s (Louise) most recent fundraiser against others in the same field to identify which times of year, and funding goals, would maximize the probability of success for future fundraisers.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- Campaigns in Quarter 1 had a success ranging near upper 50th percentile for Jan, peaking in February around lower 70% and dropping to around the upper 50th percentile in March mirroring the month of January. Failure rates ranged between mid-30 and near 40% failure percentages the entire first Quarter.

- Quarter 2 saw the greatest gain in successes starting in April, peaking in May, with a slight decline from peak success at about 10-15% per month as the launch dates moved into June at the end of Quarter 2. The failure rate increased slightly at this time but did not exceed the lower 50th percentile range.

- As Quarter 3 starts in July, this trend of success continues to decline at about a 10-15% drop per month while failure rates continue to drop slightly, to around Q1 rates in Jan and March.

- Success in the beginning of Q4 had around a 5% bump over the last month in Q3 but also had an increase of failure rate around 15%. Q4’s beginning spike of failure rate returned around Q1 levels of success and failure at the end of the year. During this increase in failure rate the success rate also dropped until meeting each other around 50% in December which greatly brough the risk and reward level to around a 50:50 ratio.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

- Fundraising amounts resulted in a range of greatest success between campaigns with 1k and up to 45k and campaign goals of 50k plus.

- The failure rate of campaigns under $1000 US dollars declined sharply with an inverse rise in success rates as campaign goals approached the $1000 dollar mark.

- Campaign goals of 5k-10k, and 15-20k showed the best results for success rates vs failures between the ranges of 5K and 25k US dollars, separated in 5k US dollar increments.

- The most successful campaigns with most predictable outcomes occurred between the fundraising goals of 25k and up to the 45k mark as well as campaigns with fundraising goals of 50k and above. There were no campaigns launched for between 45k and 50k range.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- Attention to detail.

- Making sure the column and row headers were correct.

- Ensuring formulas were in the correct format according to the directions

- Ensuring that data pulled was the correct information and that it was accurate and correct to the proper significant digiit

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- The ideal months for campaigns based on this data would fall in the order of most preferable to least preferable below.

- The Month of May for highest success rate and largest spread from failure rate.

- The Month of June if there were delays in the even for whatever complications turned up during the planning phase. This is based on June having the 2nd highest success rate and 2nd largest spread between successful campaigns and failures.	

- The Month July would be the last month I would recommend throwing a fundraiser and would only use as an absolute last measure. The success rate is the 3rd highest and the spread between success rate and failure rate is also the third highest, but May and June would be preferable.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- Given the clients relative newness to the field it would be recommended that the client would seek out fundraising campaigns in the range of $5000-$9999, and $15000-$19,000 range.  This provides the greatest success rate and the lowest failure rate given the information. Although the success rate for the larger campaigns seems to have the same success rate and failure rate as the others, given the amount of money involved with those fundraising events they are most likely run by people or organizations with more experience in the operations of the fundraising and the network and advertising connections to draw in donors that could supply fundings of $50k plus.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- Limitations of the data set would be in which areas that these fundraisers were thrown and if the entities organizing the events had much more experience in this area of fundraising. More data on this would be required before recommending the client to proceed into a project in which the lack of expertise or knowledge could affect the outcome and possibly lead to financial losses.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

- Based on the data set provided, a look into the relationship of the average amount donated and the number of backers for the above ranges of funding amounts would provide much needed data on what type of backers and how many we would need for the event to be a success along with helping the operations side of planning like the size and location of the venue and what type of people within her network the client should market the fundraiser to.
